Requirements for Installation of this package
---------------------------------------------

The following instruction is copied from [nodejs/node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation)

You can install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install -g node-gyp
```

You will also need to install:

  * On Unix:
    * `python` (`v2.7` recommended, `v3.x.x` is __*not*__ supported)
    * `make`
    * A proper C/C++ compiler toolchain, like [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org)
  * On Mac OS X:
    * `python` (`v2.7` recommended, `v3.x.x` is __*not*__ supported) (already installed on Mac OS X)
    * [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download/)
      * You also need to install the `Command Line Tools` via Xcode. You can find this under the menu `Xcode -> Preferences -> Downloads`
      * This step will install `gcc` and the related toolchain containing `make`
  * On Windows:
    * Option 1: Install all the required tools and configurations using Microsoft's [windows-build-tools](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/windows-build-tools) using `npm install --global --production windows-build-tools` from an elevated PowerShell or CMD.exe (run as Administrator).
    * Option 2: Install tools and configuration manually:
      * Visual C++ Build Environment:
        * Option 1: Install [Visual C++ Build Tools](http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools) using the **Default Install** option.

        * Option 2: Install [Visual Studio 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-community-vs) (or modify an existing installation) and select *Common Tools for Visual C++* during setup. This also works with the free Community and Express for Desktop editions.

        > :bulb: [Windows Vista / 7 only] requires [.NET Framework 4.5.1](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40773)

      * Install [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (`v3.x.x` is not supported), and run `npm config set python python2.7` (or see below for further instructions on specifying the proper Python version and path.)
      * Launch cmd, `npm config set msvs_version 2015`

    If the above steps didn't work for you, please visit [Microsoft's Node.js Guidelines for Windows](https://github.com/Microsoft/nodejs-guidelines/blob/master/windows-environment.md#compiling-native-addon-modules) for additional tips.

If you have multiple Python versions installed, you can identify which Python
version `node-gyp` uses by setting the '--python' variable:

``` bash
$ node-gyp --python /path/to/python2.7
```

If `node-gyp` is called by way of `npm` *and* you have multiple versions of
Python installed, then you can set `npm`'s 'python' config key to the appropriate
value:

``` bash
$ npm config set python /path/to/executable/python2.7
```

Note that OS X is just a flavour of Unix and so needs `python`, `make`, and C/C++.
An easy way to obtain these is to install XCode from Apple,
and then use it to install the command line tools (under Preferences -> Downloads).
